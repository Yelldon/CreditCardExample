# A Credit Card Example App
### Created for fun

This is an example app that was created for some fun to show off some things with SwiftUI animations, and things that you can do to make some forms a joy to use.

This app takes input from the user, and then, instead of a normal spinner or loading animation, this shows a example of taking the credit card and holding it against a card read, using that as the loading animation. It's for fun purposes only. It doesn't do anything beyond that.

## Some things yet to do
- Adjust the UI a bit to make things look a little nicer

<sub>**DISCLAIMER:** This app doesn't touch an API outside of the app at all, nor does it collect anything from the user. This a strictly for fun, to show off some fun animations and show what might be possible. That being said, never use actual credit card information, even on an example app like this.</sub>
